# todo-javascript-app
As a part of learning how to manipulate the DOM and how to add events , this code was basically created under the guidance of one
of the awesome developer i know. This is basically a front end app and i wish to add some new functionalities to it like storing the todos 
in a json file or some noSQL database so that the information is not lost on refreshing.

TODO ( yeah my todo :) )

1. CREATE FUNCTIONALITES FOR DISPLAYING THE TODOS IN THE CONPLETED OR PENDING LIST AS PROMTED BY THE USER\n

2. ASSIGN A PRIORITY TO THE TASKS DISPLAYING THEM IN SORTED ORDER\n

3. STORING THE TODOS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT LOST AFTER EACH REFRESH.\n

4. TRY TO ACHIEVE THESE USING node.js :)
